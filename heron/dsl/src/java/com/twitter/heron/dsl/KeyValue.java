/**
 * A Streamlet is a (potentially unbounded) ordered collection of tuples.
 Streamlets originate from pub/sub systems(such Pulsar/Kafka), or from static data(such as
 csv files, HDFS files), or for that matter any other source. They are also created by
 transforming existing Streamlets using operations such as map/flatMap, etc.
 Besides the tuples, a Streamlet has the following properties associated with it
 a) name. User assigned or system generated name to refer the streamlet
 b) nPartitions. Number of partitions that the streamlet is composed of. The nPartitions
 could be assigned by the user or computed by the system
